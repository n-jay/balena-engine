## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, send an email to `security@balena.io` detailing the
issue and steps to reproduce. We strive to acknowledge receiving reports
and reply to the author(s) within a working day.

Please *DO NOT* file a public issue containing any details before the report was
reviewed and a public disclosure timeline was agreed upon.

The reporter(s) are expected to be available for further questions/discussion
of the vulnerability and follow-up measures.
